This mumble server was started sometime between 2008 and 2010 by Fernando
(balshazar, dogonthehorizon) to coordinate in online games such as Minecraft.
It continues to be maintained by Fernando although he does not personally
join the channels much anymore.

This server is provided free of charge for the benefit of the small community
that has gathered around it. Enjoy!
