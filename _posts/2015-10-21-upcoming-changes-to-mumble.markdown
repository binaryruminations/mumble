Greetings,

If you're reading this then you pay attention to the welcome messages in Mumble!
Bully for you, friend!

From this point forward all official news and announcements will be posted to
this site. Gone are the days when maintanence windows aren't communicated!

You may notice that the configuration instructions are no longer listed in
mumble. You can now find these instructions [here][configuration] or clicking
the big ol' link in the upper right called `Configuration`.

As for upcoming changes to the server, here's the list of goodies that are
planned for the coming months:

  1. This site!
  2. Operational improvements
  * More timely server upgrades
  * Service monitoring
  * Notifications ???
  3. Remote Admin
  4. Bots ?
  5. Your feedback???

Improvements to the service are pretty open ended. If you'd like to provide
feedback on how the server runs RIGHT NOW, or you'd like to request a new
feature, then use this [handy dandy feedback form here!][feedback]

Cheers!
